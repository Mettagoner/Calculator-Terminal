# Calculator-Terminal
Calculator-Terminal Repository

Calculator-Terminal is my first solo project. I started this project to test the skills I gained from CSI and CSII at my university. Throughout the project I 
learned to use Visual Studio 2019, Semantic Versioning, Git, and Github.

To see my learning goals for each of the four versions of this project, check out the Releases tab. They are listed in the notes section of each release.

Thanks for reading!
